#AsyncTask
Here we practise how to use AsyncTask to have a task working the background to get data from API (to get film info) <br />
(1) Create a class to extend from AsyncTask <br />
(2) Implement your background code in doInBackGround & the code to be done after finishing it in onPostExecute
& if needed put the code to execute before your task in onPreExecute <br />
