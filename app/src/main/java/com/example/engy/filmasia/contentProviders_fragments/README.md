#Content Providers
Here we practise how to use content providers with accessing data from sqlite <br />
(1) Create class that extend from ContentProviders. <br />
(2) Register it in the manifest. <br />
(3) Define URIs. <br />
(4) Add URIs to the contract class. <br />
(5) Build URI matcher to match URI pattern to integer. <br />
(6) Implement required CRUD methods. <br />
